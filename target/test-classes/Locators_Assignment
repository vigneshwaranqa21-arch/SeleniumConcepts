1. What are locators? Explain the importance of locators.
Locators are used to identify web elements on a webpage.
They help Selenium interact with UI elements.
Examples include id, name, class, xpath, cssSelector.
Accurate locators make automation stable and reliable.
Poor locators cause flaky and failing tests.

2. Explain types of XPath with examples.
Absolute XPath starts from root node (/html/body/…).
Relative XPath starts from any node (//input[@id='user']).
XPath using attribute: //div[@id='div'].
XPath using contains(): //div[contains(@class,'textbox')].
XPath using index: (//div[@class='textbox div'])[1].

3. Create XPath and CSS Selector for given elements.
XPath for first div: (//div[@placeholder='user'])[1].
XPath for second div: (//div[@placeholder='name'])[1].
CSS for first div: div[placeholder='user'].
CSS for second div: div[placeholder='name'].
Attributes help uniquely identify similar elements.
